{"id":"pe-yi78","title":"Infinite respawn loop: daemon uses wrong prefix for polecat health checks","description":"The daemon's checkPolecatHealth uses beads.PolecatBeadID() which hardcodes 'gt' prefix, but rigs use different prefixes (e.g., perch uses 'pe-'). This causes the daemon to look for agent beads in the wrong database.\n\nRoot cause:\n- Daemon calls beads.PolecatBeadID(rigName, polecatName) → generates 'gt-perch-polecat-*'\n- Perch's actual prefix is 'pe-', so agent beads are 'pe-perch-polecat-*'\n- Daemon reads stale 'gt-*' beads from roles database instead of current 'pe-*' beads\n- This can cause incorrect respawn decisions\n\nAffected: perch polecats ace, valkyrie, keeper, cheedo, toast, warboy, morsov\nWorking: dag (respawned WITH work), slit, rictus, dementus, furiosa, nux, capable\n\nFix needed: daemon should query beads using the rig's actual prefix, not hardcoded 'gt'.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-01-07T14:07:46.344715-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-07T14:10:48.571435-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-07T14:10:48.571435-08:00","close_reason":"Fixed in commit b0f3f31: daemon now uses GetPrefixForRig() to get the correct prefix for each rig instead of hardcoded 'gt'.
